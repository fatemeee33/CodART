|     Code smell                             |     Descriptions and other names                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|     God class                              |     The class defines many data members (fields) and methods   and exhibits low cohesion. The god class smell occurs when a huge class surrounded   by many data classes acts as a controller (i.e., takes most of the decisions   and monopolizes the software's functionality).       Other names: Blob, large   class, brain class.    |
|     Long method                            |     This smell occurs when a method is too long to understand   and most presumably perform more than one responsibility.       Other names: God   method, brain method, large method.                                                                                                                                                    |
|     Feature envy                           |     This smell occurs when a method seems more interested in a   class other than the one it actually is in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|     Data class                             |     This smell occurs when a class contains only fields and   possibly getters/setters without any behavior (methods).                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|     Shotgun surgery                        |     This smell characterizes the situation when one kind of   change leads to many changes to multiple different classes. When the changes   are all over the place, they are hard to find, and it is easy to miss a   necessary change.                                                                                                  |
|     Refused bequest                        |     This smell occurs when a subclass rejects some of the   methods or properties offered by its superclass.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|     Functional decomposition               |     This smell occurs when the experienced developers coming   from procedural languages background write highly procedural and   non-object-oriented code in an object-oriented language.                                                                                                                                                |
|     Long parameter list                    |     This smell occurs when a method accepts a long list of   parameters. Such lists are hard to understand and difficult to use.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|     Promiscuous package                    |     A package can be considered promiscuous if it contains   classes implementing too many features, making it too hard to understand and   maintain. As for god class and long method, this smell arises when the   package has low cohesion since it manages different responsibilities.                                                |
|     Misplaced class                        |     A Misplaced Class smell suggests a class that is in a   package that contains other classes not related to it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|     Switch statement                       |     This smell occurs when switch statements that switch on   type codes are spread across the software system instead of exploiting polymorphism.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|     Spaghetti code                         |     This smell refers to an unmaintainable, incomprehensible   code without any structure. The smell does not exploit and prevents the use   of object-orientation mechanisms and concepts.                                                                                                                                               |
|     Divergent change                       |     Divergent change occurs when one class is commonly changed   in different ways for different reasons.     Other names: Multifaceted abstraction                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|     Deficient encapsulation                |     This smell occurs when the declared accessibility of one   or more members of abstraction is more permissive than actually required.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|     Swiss army knife                       |     This smell arises when the designer attempts to provide   all possible uses of the class and ends up in an excessively complex class   interface.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|     Lazy class                             |     Unnecessary abstraction                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|     Cyclically-dependent modularization    |     This smell arises when two or more abstractions depend on   each other directly or indirectly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|     Primitive obsession                    |     This smell occurs when primitive data types are used where   an abstraction encapsulating the primitives could serve better.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|     Speculative generality                 |     This smell occurs where abstraction is created based on   speculated requirements. It is often unnecessary that makes things difficult   to understand and maintain.                                                                                                                                                                  |
|     Message chains                         |     A message chain occurs when a client requests another   object, that object requests yet another one, and so on. These chains mean   that the client is dependent on navigation along with the class structure.   Any changes in these relationships require modifying the client.                                                    |
|     Total                                  |     20                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
